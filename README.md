# Dotify
## Homework 3 - Fragments, Activity Lifecycles, & Rotation
Author: Anthony Chiang

This is the readme for the Dotify app. The Dotify app currently consists of a playlist and a song info page, implemented using fragments and onSavedInstanceState.

No extra credit attempted.

NOTE: I was only able to finish part 1 and 2 before the 11:59 deadline. I was not able to finish rotation at this commit. I'll finish part 3 and make another commit past the deadline, please take the commit history into account during grading, thanks.
